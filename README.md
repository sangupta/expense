Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility,
`expense` will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

	<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
